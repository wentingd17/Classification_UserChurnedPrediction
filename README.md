# Prediction: Credit Card Churned

##Abstract
The goal of this project was to predict credit card holders who are likely to churn, in order to help the credit card company identify the targets they would like to reach out to with the 0% APR offers, thus to improve customer retentions. The data I worked with was a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers). This dataset contains 10,127 unique customers, and the features include demographic information and the credit card usage information. This is an imbalanced data with 16% customers who have churned. The final model was built by using XGBoost, and it was able to achieve a 0.89 F2 score and a 0.99 AUC score.
